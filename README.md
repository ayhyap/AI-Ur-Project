Run test2.py, test1.py does nothing on its own.

Use move(color = 0 (black) or 1 (white), pieceNo = 1 to 7, moves = 0 to 4) to move pieces. PieceNo of move() is defined as the n-th furthest piece on the board of that color which is not at the end.

Use getPiecePositions(color = 0 (black) or 1 (white)) to get a sorted array of piece positions of that color (largest first).
